ROSTful Examples
================


This repository hold different usage examples for ROSTful, depending on which backend system you want to interface with.

The only example currently is ROS, but more could be added later.

ROSTful is a usual python web package, and relies on the Pyros framework underneath to interface between multiple distributed systems.
It can therefore be used to add REST endpoints to any system that has an interface in pyros.
